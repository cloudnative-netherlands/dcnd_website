We believe that everyone should be able to participate in a welcoming space free from harassment and discrimination. All participants are expected to behave with integrity and respect toward everyone involved with Dutch Cloud Native Day.

## Scope / Applicability

## Report Contact Details
Our Code of Conduct team members are publicly announced at each event. 
The team is available during all official events—including the speaker dinner and social event(s)—and remains sober throughout the event.

- **Any** other behavior that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.  

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply **immediately**.

## Complaint Process
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, **contact a member of the conference staff or Code of Conduct team immediately**.  
Conference staff can be identified by distinct staff badges.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

Examples of possible actions include (but are not limited to):

1. Undertaking a fact-finding exercise.  
2. Requesting the offender to immediately stop the offending behavior.  
3. Suspending or terminating the offender’s access to the event.  
4. Conveying the complaint to any investigative or disciplinary authority with jurisdiction over the person accused of harassment.  
5. Contacting the offender’s employer for appropriate follow-up action.  

We’re happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. **We value your attendance.**
