## Dutch Cloud Native Day

Dutch Cloud Native Days is a community driven event dedicated to bringing together cloud native enthusiasts, AI practitioners and plaform gurus from across Europe...and beyond. Our mission is to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for attendees of all experience levels—whether you're just starting out or have years of expertise. We aim to foster the adoption of cloud-native technologies and provide a platform for the community to share experiences, learn from each other, and explore best practices. Above all, we believe in the power of collaboration and community to drive innovation and the future of cloud computing.

Inclusivity and diversity are at the heart of Dutch Cloud Native Day. We warmly welcome attendees from all backgrounds and identities to join us in creating an inspiring and supportive space for everyone.

## A New Chapter for a Trusted Community Event

After several successful editions as a community-driven event, we have chosen to organize this year’s edition under a new name: Dutch Cloud Native Days (DCND). This decision reflects our continued commitment to serving the Dutch cloud native community through an open, inclusive, and vendor-neutral event—organized by the community, for the community. The format, quality, and values you’ve come to expect remain unchanged.

This year’s conference will feature the same high-quality content and speakers selected through our CFP process, and we will continue to uphold our commitment to transparency with a post-event report and a strong Code of Conduct to ensure a safe and welcoming environment for all.

We thank our community, sponsors, and partners for their ongoing support during this transition. While we are moving forward as DCND this year, we remain open to exploring future editions under the [KCD](https://www.cncf.io/kcds/) banner, depending on the evolving needs and opportunities within our community.

### Strengthening the Community

We would like to use this change as an opportunity to lay a solid foundation for the future. That’s why, starting with the 2025 edition, the event will be hosted with the support of [Stichting Cloud Native Netherlands](https://cloudnativenetherlands.nl/), a non-profit organization that acts as a supporter and fiscal sponsor for the Dutch cloud native community.
