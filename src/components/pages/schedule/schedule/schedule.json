            "description": "It’s undeniable that Kubernetes changed the Tech industry. It changed the way we build and deploy workloads. True there are still organizations out there doing it the old school way. But almost everyone is looking at containers and Kubernetes as a potential way forward. When Kubernetes was released a decade ago it was built to run APIs and backend. But things took a drastic shift with the emergence of AI, ML, Games, Edge... The community supported by various vendors worked hard on implementing new features to meet the requirements of these new use cases. And as we move forward in this new space of GenAI and with WebAssembly creeping up as a contender to containers. Kubernetes will play a key role in enabling people to build and run apps even faster. In this talk Abdel will reflect on what happened in the Kubernetes and Containers space in the last decade and what the future looks like for the project and the community as whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

            "description": "The majority of Kubernetes users needing to expose an HTTP application, will have come across the Ingress API. The ingress API is widely adopted and well documented. There are also a wide range of stable ingress controllers to choose from. The current ingress implementation has some limitations. The Ingress controller only handles layer 7 traffic, while an ingress routes HTTP and HTTPS traffic. This means it is not possible to route TCP and UDP traffic. Ingress also lacks native support for more advanced routing features such as traffic splitting, header modification, and URL rewriting. To solve this problem, Kubernetes has introduced the gateway API. Gateway API is an open-source project, managed by SIG networking. The goal is to evolve Kubernetes service networking through expressive, extensible, and role-oriented interfaces. During my talk I will demonstrate the key differences between the two existing API’s. I will introduce you to the new gateway API resources. We will also talk about the available roles and personas. And possible options to migrate your existing ingress resources. I will finish off with a demo showing Cilium CNI and the Gateway API to manage ingress traffic.  \r\n",

While Helm is the most popular tool, it’s also the only one that allows you to bundle YAML manifests, configure `packages`, and version-control deployments, among many other features. Four years after Helm graduated, we ask the question: What’s next? And if we create a new package manager targeting Kubernetes workloads, how would it look?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Anais will first discuss the history of package managers for infrastructure management and how Helm has become the de facto standard in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Next, we will explore different use cases and potential shortcomings of Helm and Timoni, as well as how those are solved with other tooling we see within GitOps, IaC and Platform Engineering. Following the discussion, Philip will introduce Glasskube, an open source package manager for cloud native environments.",

Each level of observability demands a certain price in terms of configuration and runtime overhead. In turn the quality and depth of the information is different.\r\n\r\nThe intended take-away is to get an understanding which type of tooling is the right one for a given purpose.",

Understanding all the components of a complex distributed system, and then managing them via the secret code we call \"yaml\", is not for the faint-hearted.\r\nThe Kubernetes dashboard provides some level of graphical representation of a running system, but doesn't help with getting started from scratch, nor multi-cluster deployments, nor provide an integrated user experience across the multiple tools and projects required in a modern Kubernetes environment.\r\nIn this session, we will explain how Headlamp, a CNCF sandbox project, addresses these challenges with its ambition to be the primary graphical user interface for new and experienced users alike.",

            "description": "In today's fast-paced software development landscape, maintaining complex, YAML-based CI/CD pipelines can become a bottleneck, leading to what many developers lament as \"YAML Soup\". This talk proposes a revolutionary shift with the adoption of Dagger, developed by Solomon Hykes's team, which replaces traditional, error-prone scripting with a robust, language-agnostic API and cross-language scripting engine. This session aims to demonstrate how Dagger enables developers to write their pipelines as code directly within the language of their project, thereby enhancing readability, maintainability, and scalability.\r\n\r\nWe will start with an overview of Dagger, discussing its core concepts and advantages over traditional pipeline configurations. The presentation will include a detailed walkthrough of transitioning from a YAML-based pipeline to a Dagger-based setup, illustrating the process with real-world examples and best practices. Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of implementing Dagger in their projects, leading to more efficient and manageable development workflows.",

            "description": "Cluster API is a great tool to manage the lifecycle of your Kubernetes cluster. But it doesn't tell you how to configure your cluster. It doesn't take care of installing a CCM, CNI, etc. It also doesn't tell you how your node images should look like.\r\n\r\nIn reality, maintaining a Kubernetes platform with Cluster API requires a lot of configuration files and additional tools on top that manage the lifecycle of the core cluster components, the cluster addons.\r\n\r\nOur answer is the Cluster Stack Framework. In this framework, all configurations that are necessary for a cluster, including node images and cluster addons, are bundled and released together.\r\n\r\nThe Cluster Stack Operator takes care of the lifecycle of Cluster Stacks for users. \r\n\r\nThe controller manages cluster addons and applies them in a multi-stage process and is integrated into the Cluster API lifecycle using the CAPI hooks.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know about how we manage Kubernetes platforms with Cluster API, join us!",

Traditional allow/deny lists become unmanageable as deployments grow, leading to security gaps and operational bottlenecks. Add workload identity management and application-level access policies to the picture, and you get a never-ending puzzle to solve on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nBut what if you could dynamically generate network and application-level policies, or even Istio authorization policies, by detecting traffic patterns with BPF and directly polling metrics from Envoy, and build an \"Intent\" custom resources?  This would alleviate a lot of the hurdle and allow for healthier, faster growth of your most valuable business applications.\r\n\r\nJoin Nic in this talk, where he’s going to introduce and demonstrate how Otterize has developed an intent-based operator together with an BPF network mapper operator to make this dream come true! “Wow effect guaranteed”, that’s what the otter said!",

How do new features impact the energy used by the software? We will discuss this together. After the demo we will close up with some technical considerations related to what we have done, what is left unmeasured and how this is just a first step towards a energy-aware cloud.",

              "description": "It’s undeniable that Kubernetes changed the Tech industry. It changed the way we build and deploy workloads. True there are still organizations out there doing it the old school way. But almost everyone is looking at containers and Kubernetes as a potential way forward. When Kubernetes was released a decade ago it was built to run APIs and backend. But things took a drastic shift with the emergence of AI, ML, Games, Edge... The community supported by various vendors worked hard on implementing new features to meet the requirements of these new use cases. And as we move forward in this new space of GenAI and with WebAssembly creeping up as a contender to containers. Kubernetes will play a key role in enabling people to build and run apps even faster. In this talk Abdel will reflect on what happened in the Kubernetes and Containers space in the last decade and what the future looks like for the project and the community as whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

After all, “you build it, you run it”?\r\n\r\nThis session will present the speaker’s learnings in platform engineering, consulting and sales engineering roles and show how adopting product management practices can improve the situation.\r\nIt will explain how to clarify the value and benefits of your container platform for developers and other stakeholders, especially by creating a platform architecture which is not only focused on technical features. It will also explain how to solve some of the specific challenges of container platform – for example, how to make platform capabilities visible and understandable to a broad and varied audience.",

The lessons learned and tips shared will help teams bring more projects to their platforms without complicating end-to-end workflows.",

              "description": "The majority of Kubernetes users needing to expose an HTTP application, will have come across the Ingress API. The ingress API is widely adopted and well documented. There are also a wide range of stable ingress controllers to choose from. The current ingress implementation has some limitations. The Ingress controller only handles layer 7 traffic, while an ingress routes HTTP and HTTPS traffic. This means it is not possible to route TCP and UDP traffic. Ingress also lacks native support for more advanced routing features such as traffic splitting, header modification, and URL rewriting. To solve this problem, Kubernetes has introduced the gateway API. Gateway API is an open-source project, managed by SIG networking. The goal is to evolve Kubernetes service networking through expressive, extensible, and role-oriented interfaces. During my talk I will demonstrate the key differences between the two existing API’s. I will introduce you to the new gateway API resources. We will also talk about the available roles and personas. And possible options to migrate your existing ingress resources. I will finish off with a demo showing Cilium CNI and the Gateway API to manage ingress traffic.  \r\n",

While Helm is the most popular tool, it’s also the only one that allows you to bundle YAML manifests, configure `packages`, and version-control deployments, among many other features. Four years after Helm graduated, we ask the question: What’s next? And if we create a new package manager targeting Kubernetes workloads, how would it look?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Anais will first discuss the history of package managers for infrastructure management and how Helm has become the de facto standard in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Next, we will explore different use cases and potential shortcomings of Helm and Timoni, as well as how those are solved with other tooling we see within GitOps, IaC and Platform Engineering. Following the discussion, Philip will introduce Glasskube, an open source package manager for cloud native environments.",

It doesn't take care of installing a CCM, CNI, etc. It also doesn't tell you how your node images should look like.\r\n\r\nIn reality, maintaining a Kubernetes platform with Cluster API requires a lot of configuration files and additional tools on top that manage the lifecycle of the core cluster components, the cluster addons.\r\n\r\nOur answer is the Cluster Stack Framework. In this framework, all configurations that are necessary for a cluster, including node images and cluster addons, are bundled and released together.\r\n\r\nThe Cluster Stack Operator takes care of the lifecycle of Cluster Stacks for users. \r\n\r\nThe controller manages cluster addons and applies them in a multi-stage process and is integrated into the Cluster API lifecycle using the CAPI hooks.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know about how we manage Kubernetes platforms with Cluster API, join us!",

Each level of observability demands a certain price in terms of configuration and runtime overhead. In turn the quality and depth of the information is different.\r\n\r\nThe intended take-away is to get an understanding which type of tooling is the right one for a given purpose.",

This talk proposes a revolutionary shift with the adoption of Dagger, developed by Solomon Hykes's team, which replaces traditional, error-prone scripting with a robust, language-agnostic API and cross-language scripting engine. This session aims to demonstrate how Dagger enables developers to write their pipelines as code directly within the language of their project, thereby enhancing readability, maintainability, and scalability.\r\n\r\nWe will start with an overview of Dagger, discussing its core concepts and advantages over traditional pipeline configurations. The presentation will include a detailed walkthrough of transitioning from a YAML-based pipeline to a Dagger-based setup, illustrating the process with real-world examples and best practices. Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of implementing Dagger in their projects, leading to more efficient and manageable development workflows.",

They are serving end users, but currently, they are also endangering those users, the system, and themselves! But the struggle for security is HARD, filled with system design choices concerning secrets management; cluster-level, runtime, and network policies; and image scanning and signing.\r\n\r\nIt is up to you, the audience, to guide our hero and help them grow from a vulnerable, unprotected application to their final form⎯an app that is secure against invasion. In their third ‘Choose Your Own Adventure’-style talk, Whitney and Viktor will present choices that an anthropomorphized app must make as they try to protect themselves against every kind of exploit. Throughout the presentation, the audience (YOU!) will vote to decide our hero app's path! Can we navigate CNCF projects to safeguard our app, system, and users against attack before the session time elapses?",

As engineers we focus a fair amount on Automation, Lean and Measurement, they kind of come natural to us as they’re tech related, but not as much on Culture and Sharing usually, we seem to find that a little more difficult.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I'll go over some strategies, or lessons, common place to primary school teachers that are novel to us, but shouldn't be, and how it will help us in our day to day activities in ensuring we achieve full CALMS.",

The traditional security paradigm, which is based on perimeter-based security, static security controls, and a reactive security posture, is no longer sufficient to protect cloud native environments.\r\n\r\nThis talk will discuss the need for a new security paradigm in the cloud native world. It will introduce the concepts of zero-trust security, shift-left security, and continuous security, and explain how these concepts can be applied to cloud native environments. The talk will also discuss the benefits of the new security paradigm, such as improved security posture, reduced risk, and increased agility and scalability.\r\n\r\nFinally, the talk will provide some examples of organizations that have successfully implemented the new security paradigm, and discuss some emerging cloud native security technologies.",

In this session, we discuss why Wasm is the ideal & greenest unit of compute for Serverless applications and how you can get started using Serverless Wasm with Spin - an open source developer tool. We’ll demo running AI inferencing Spin applications and discuss how it also enables better GPU resource sharing. By the end, you’ll have an understanding of the characteristics that make Wasm a cost-effective and sustainable unit for a greener cloud.",

            "description": "In the ever-evolving landscape of Confidential Computing, Confidential Containers (CoCo) have now established themselves as a robust option for deploying secure workloads. With Microsoft Azure's recent integration of CoCo in their Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), the technology's transition to mainstream production use is evident. CoCo expertly bridges the gap between Intel SGX Enclaves, which offer tight Trusted Computing Base (TCB) and single-workload isolation, and the simplicity of deploying confidential VMs or clusters.\r\n\r\nThis presentation delves into the core advancements in CoCo, particularly its adaptation of VM isolation technologies like AMD SEV or Intel TDX for containerized applications. However, with this achievement comes the need to address familiar challenges in securing distributed containerized systems, akin to those faced with Intel SGX. We will outline these issues, focusing on the complexities of attesting distributed applications and securing container-to-container communications. Additionally, we will examine the nuanced role of Kubernetes in orchestrating these workloads, emphasizing the critical balance between keeping the application isolated from the untrusted orchestrator while maintaining the usability and workflows for the operations team.\r\n\r\nOur discussion will then pivot to innovative solutions, highlighting the concept of execution policies adopted by the CoCo community for effective workload attestation. By revisiting distributed attestation and orchestration principles from the open-source MarbleRun project initially designed for SGX environments, we will explore their potential application in CoCo contexts.\r\n\r\nThe session culminates with a practical demonstration. We will showcase the deployment of a distributed microservice application using unmodified confidential containers. This demo will illustrate not only the protection of service-to-service communications but also the comprehensive attestation of the application as a unified entity, all within a managed Kubernetes framework. This talk aims to provide a deep dive into the current state and future possibilities of CoCo, offering attendees insights into tackling real-world challenges in cloud-native Confidential Computing.",

One of them is the CNCF project Knative, which enables auto-scaling based on incoming HTTP requests. Advantages over Kubernetes default auto-scaling capabilities (HPA, VPA) include faster response to load and support for scale-to-zero. I will show you how much you can reduce cold start times (the delay in serving requests when scaling from zero) and discuss advantages and disadvantages as well as possible use cases.",

That way, developers can run their code locally and debug it with a debugger. With all of the code's input and output forwarded to and from the cluster, the local process “thinks” it’s running in the cluster and can be tested and debugged in cloud conditions.\r\nThis talk will discuss the rationale behind using low-level techniques in cloud-native tooling, explain some of the low level Rust code that makes it possible, and show mirrord in action with a live demo.",

            "description": "The stateful nature of WebSockets carries inherent complexities regarding horizontal scaling. Kubernetes is a natural fit for stateless workloads, but operating scalable stateful applications can be challenging.\r\n\r\nWe discuss these challenges in the context of an EV charging IoT platform. A concrete problem we faced revolves around WebSocket reconnection storms: if thousands of charging stations lose their connection, e.g., due to regional network carrier outages, they all try to reconnect simultaneously once the network issue is resolved, thus causing large load spikes. These load spikes propagate across our systems, potentially causing positive feedback loops and introducing instability.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we dive into the intricacies of scaling out WebSockets and how we evolved the system architecture towards event-driven communication. We discuss how introducing a Redis-based circuit-breaker component in the connection flow helped us alleviate bottlenecks and improve system stability.",

Nowadays systems are broken up into smaller microservices deployed in containers on top of Kubernetes in multiple clusters across different cloud environments. In these kinds of distributed environments, there is a need to observe it all, both the overall picture, and, if need be, at a more granular level.\r\n\r\nObservability can be roughly divided into three sub-categories: logging, metrics, and tracing. In this blog post we’ll show you how simple it is to get set up with tracing in your new or existing MinIO application. We’ll build a small MinIO app that does a few basic requests; this will be our base application to which we’ll add tracing to gain a better picture of how system components and functions interact.",

Then this is the workshop for you!\r\n\r\nFolks often underestimate how the way you carry yourself can make all the difference between an engaging talk and a total snoozefest. And this isn’t only relevant to public speaking. But any face to face interactions like meetings or social gatherings can benefit from a bit of “stage presence”.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, we will learn how to be truly present and connect with our bodies, packed with exercises and games, commonly used in theatre productions. So at your next presentation, you can use these techniques to draw in your audience.",

They are serving end users, but currently, they are also endangering those users, the system, and themselves! But the struggle for security is HARD, filled with system design choices concerning secrets management; cluster-level, runtime, and network policies; and image scanning and signing.\r\n\r\nIt is up to you, the audience, to guide our hero and help them grow from a vulnerable, unprotected application to their final form⎯an app that is secure against invasion. In their third ‘Choose Your Own Adventure’-style talk, Whitney and Viktor will present choices that an anthropomorphized app must make as they try to protect themselves against every kind of exploit. Throughout the presentation, the audience (YOU!) will vote to decide our hero app's path! Can we navigate CNCF projects to safeguard our app, system, and users against attack before the session time elapses?",

              "description": "Over the years I've heard from my partner about strategies implemented by teachers to enable children in class to learn, progress and excel, thinking this would be great for the tech industry and fits right into the DevOps culture!\r\n\r\nWe can assess our ability to adopt or assess the progression of adoption of DevOps processes through the CALMS framework. As engineers we focus a fair amount on Automation, Lean and Measurement, they kind of come natural to us as they’re tech related, but not as much on Culture and Sharing usually, we seem to find that a little more difficult.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I'll go over some strategies, or lessons, common place to primary school teachers that are novel to us, but shouldn't be, and how it will help us in our day to day activities in ensuring we achieve full CALMS.",

              "description": "Many tools exist for debugging cloud-native applications, and they mostly take one of two approaches: they either continuously sync local files to the remote container, or they connect the local machine to the cluster. mirrord takes a novel approach: when developers run their code with mirrord, it injects a dynamic library into the process, hooks libc calls, and relays some operations to be executed on the cluster instead of locally. That way, developers can run their code locally and debug it with a debugger. With all of the code's input and output forwarded to and from the cluster, the local process “thinks” it’s running in the cluster and can be tested and debugged in cloud conditions.\r\nThis talk will discuss the rationale behind using low-level techniques in cloud-native tooling, explain some of the low level Rust code that makes it possible, and show mirrord in action with a live demo.",

And this isn’t only relevant to public speaking. But any face to face interactions like meetings or social gatherings can benefit from a bit of “stage presence”.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, we will learn how to be truly present and connect with our bodies, packed with exercises and games, commonly used in theatre productions. So at your next presentation, you can use these techniques to draw in your audience.",

The traditional security paradigm, which is based on perimeter-based security, static security controls, and a reactive security posture, is no longer sufficient to protect cloud native environments.\r\n\r\nThis talk will discuss the need for a new security paradigm in the cloud native world. It will introduce the concepts of zero-trust security, shift-left security, and continuous security, and explain how these concepts can be applied to cloud native environments. The talk will also discuss the benefits of the new security paradigm, such as improved security posture, reduced risk, and increased agility and scalability.\r\n\r\nFinally, the talk will provide some examples of organizations that have successfully implemented the new security paradigm, and discuss some emerging cloud native security technologies.",

In this session, we discuss why Wasm is the ideal & greenest unit of compute for Serverless applications and how you can get started using Serverless Wasm with Spin - an open source developer tool. We’ll demo running AI inferencing Spin applications and discuss how it also enables better GPU resource sharing.

Kubernetes is a natural fit for stateless workloads, but operating scalable stateful applications can be challenging.\r\n\r\nWe discuss these challenges in the context of an EV charging IoT platform. A concrete problem we faced revolves around WebSocket reconnection storms: if thousands of charging stations lose their connection, e.g., due to regional network carrier outages, they all try to reconnect simultaneously once the network issue is resolved, thus causing large load spikes. These load spikes propagate across our systems, potentially causing positive feedback loops and introducing instability.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we dive into the intricacies of scaling out WebSockets and how we evolved the system architecture towards event-driven communication. We discuss how introducing a Redis-based circuit-breaker component in the connection flow helped us alleviate bottlenecks and improve system stability.",

              "description": "In the ever-evolving landscape of Confidential Computing, Confidential Containers (CoCo) have now established themselves as a robust option for deploying secure workloads. With Microsoft Azure's recent integration of CoCo in their Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), the technology's transition to mainstream production use is evident. CoCo expertly bridges the gap between Intel SGX Enclaves, which offer tight Trusted Computing Base (TCB) and single-workload isolation, and the simplicity of deploying confidential VMs or clusters.\r\n\r\nThis presentation delves into the core advancements in CoCo, particularly its adaptation of VM isolation technologies like AMD SEV or Intel TDX for containerized applications. However, with this achievement comes the need to address familiar challenges in securing distributed containerized systems, akin to those faced with Intel SGX. We will outline these issues, focusing on the complexities of attesting distributed applications and securing container-to-container communications. Additionally, we will examine the nuanced role of Kubernetes in orchestrating these workloads, emphasizing the critical balance between keeping the application isolated from the untrusted orchestrator while maintaining the usability and workflows for the operations team.\r\n\r\nOur discussion will then pivot to innovative solutions, highlighting the concept of execution policies adopted by the CoCo community for effective workload attestation. By revisiting distributed attestation and orchestration principles from the open-source MarbleRun project initially designed for SGX environments, we will explore their potential application in CoCo contexts.\r\n\r\nThe session culminates with a practical demonstration. We will showcase the deployment of a distributed microservice application using unmodified confidential containers. This demo will illustrate not only the protection of service-to-service communications but also the comprehensive attestation of the application as a unified entity, all within a managed Kubernetes framework. This talk aims to provide a deep dive into the current state and future possibilities of CoCo, offering attendees insights into tackling real-world challenges in cloud-native Confidential Computing.",

Nowadays systems are broken up into smaller microservices deployed in containers on top of Kubernetes in multiple clusters across different cloud environments. In these kinds of distributed environments, there is a need to observe it all, both the overall picture, and, if need be, at a more granular level.\r\n\r\nObservability can be roughly divided into three sub-categories: logging, metrics, and tracing. In this blog post we’ll show you how simple it is to get set up with tracing in your new or existing MinIO application. We’ll build a small MinIO app that does a few basic requests; this will be our base application to which we’ll add tracing to gain a better picture of how system components and functions interact.",

This is beneficial for a wide range of applications, but especially for use-cases with sudden traffic spikes such as e-commerce platforms during flash sales, streaming services broadcasting live events with fluctuating viewer numbers, and financial services handling transactions during volatile market conditions. \r\n\r\nFor Kubernetes, there are various approaches. One of them is the CNCF project Knative, which enables auto-scaling based on incoming HTTP requests. Advantages over Kubernetes default auto-scaling capabilities (HPA, VPA) include faster response to load and support for scale-to-zero. I will show you how much you can reduce cold start times (the delay in serving requests when scaling from zero) and discuss advantages and disadvantages as well as possible use cases.",

              "description": "The cloud native ecosystem currently has no consistent Open Source Threat Intelligence. The community initiative \"The Kubernetes Storm Center\" aims to change that.\r\nIn this talk, we show how a non-expert would use a \"Honey-Cluster\" to practically validate threat modelling predictions and quantify the relative risk of different attack vectors. And, as an optional step, how to contribute the collected threat intelligence to (open) upstream databases such as MISP, by mapping the threats onto MITRE.\r\n\r\nAfter a general introduction, we detail how to utilize and adopt our method that, based on a given threat model:\r\na) generates a Kubernetes-based environment with embedded eBPF trip-wires, enabling the detection of real attacker paths without interference,\r\nb) exposes these simulated environments to the wild to observe quantitative threat intelligence in action, and\r\nc) informs cost-effective decisions for a defensive team.\r\nWe discuss recent community development and remaining caveats, emphasise the critical role of automation in scalability across diverse threat models, live showcase one quantified attack tree and discuss data we have collected from experiments, so far.\r\n\r\nTo benefit the Kubernetes ecosystem, this accessible framework can be crowd-sourced into an open source threat intelligence capturing network for risk exposure quantification.",

While ingress annotations had there unique set of challenges such as maintainability and complexity, the latter meant opting-out of the massive ecosystem that is provided. Gateway API as the new, extensible foundation, Kubernetes provides a unique opportunity, since that symbioses already covers a wide variety of use-cases in terms of how we roll out applications and how they get the traffic they need.\r\n\r\nIn this talk you will gain a high level overview of the Gateway API and its extension layers, its community and adoption as well as a live demo of how multiple projects (namely Traefik, external-dns, cert-manager and Argo Rollouts) can be used together to rollout an application quickly and in an automated way",
